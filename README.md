# Pong-Game

Description:

Welcome to my Python mini-project!I have created a simple Pong game using Python and the Turtle module.

Project Overview:
In this project, I've implemented the classic Pong game using Python. Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles and try to hit a ball back and forth across the screen without missing it. The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard to keep track of the score.

Key Features:

Player-controlled paddles using keyboard inputs.
Ball movement and collision detection.
Score tracking and display.
Game over condition and winner announcement.
Technologies Used:

Python
Turtle module for graphics
Time module for time management

How to Run the Code:

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
Download the source code from the GitHub repository (link provided).
Run the main.py file using a Python interpreter.
Use the keyboard arrow keys (Up/Down) to control the right paddle and the 'w'/'s' keys to control the left paddle.
Press the 'q' key to quit the game.
         "ENJOY"
